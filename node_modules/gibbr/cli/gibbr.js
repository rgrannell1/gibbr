	Name:
		gibbr - A utility for scrambling file names.

	Usage:
		gibbr [--no-preserve-root|--preserve-root] [-s X|--size X] [--] -
		gibbr [--no-preserve-root|--preserve-root] [-s X|--size X] [--] [<path>...]
		gibbr (-h|--help|--version)

	Description:
		gibbr is a utility for scrambling filenames. It accepts file or folder paths,
		and renames the filename/last portion of the path with a random string.

		gibbr does NOT recur into folders; to rename recursively pipe file names into gibbr
		from 'find', 'ls', or a similar utility.

	Implementation:

		The created file names are mixed case letters (52), so there are approximately 7 * 10 ^ 30
		unique file names generated by default. This would mean you would need to create approximately 10^17
		before you had a 50% chance of creating a duplicate file name, meaning these are unlikely to
		duplicate filenames during normal usage.

		gibbr preserves file extensions, or more specifically any text following a period in a file basename.
		For example, renaming foo.tar.gz will preserve the extension '.tar.gz'.

	Arguments:
		<path>...             the filepaths to rename. Use '-' to read from standard input.

	Options:

		--no-preserve-root    do not treat the path '/' specially.
		--preserve-root       do not rename or modify the path '/' or its contents. Default behaviour.
		-s X, --size X        the length of the new filename, excluding file extensions [default: 20].
		-h, --help            display this document.
